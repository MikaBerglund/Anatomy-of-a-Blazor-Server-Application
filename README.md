Anatomy of a Blazor Server Application
======================================

A sample minimal Blazor Server application that is built from the ASP.NET Core 3 Empty project template in Visual Studio 2019.

I wrote a blog post about this sample application. The blog post can be found at [mikaberglund.com/2019/10/03/the-anatomy-of-a-blazor-server-application](https://mikaberglund.com/2019/10/03/the-anatomy-of-a-blazor-server-application/).
